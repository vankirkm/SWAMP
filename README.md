## What is a S.W.A.M.P?  
S.W.A.M.P is an acronym for Self-Watering and Moving Plant. S.W.A.M.P makes use of a variety of sensors to carry its plant buddy towards its optimal lighting environment. Additionally, the S.W.A.M.P makes use of pH sensors and moisture sensors to keep track of the plant's soil health over time. Through a web application, users can also manually control the robot and set lighting/soil health parameters.
